# The SK Programming Language

SK is a conceptual programming language designed to handle incomplete, approximate, or partially known information as first-class entities. Unlike traditional languages, SK does **not assume all variables have exact values**. Instead, it tracks uncertainty explicitly throughout calculations, decisions, and control flow.  

The language is designed for **safer, more honest, and analyzable computation** in contexts where data may be noisy, incomplete, or evolving.
